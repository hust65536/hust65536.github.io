  "body": "# Project5: 3D Rigid Object Tracking\r\nThe objective of 3D rigid object tracking is to associate 3D target objects in consecutive video frames and meanwhile estimate the relative pose (3D translation and 3D rotation) between the 3D target and the camera. Rigid means the relative position among object components do not change. For instance, a cup, a book and a car are rigid object while a human face and a cat are non-rigid object. It has a variety of uses, some of which are: humancomputer interaction, security and surveillance, video communicationand compression, augmented reality, traffic control, medical imaging and video editing. 3D object tracking can be especially difficult when the objects are moving fast relative to the frame rate. Another situation that increases the complexity of the problem is when the tracked object changes orientation over time. For these situations the tracking system usually employs a motion model which describes how the image of the target might change for different possible motions of the object.\r\n## To  Do List  \r\n*2016/5/20*  \r\n搭建网站,阅读文献。  \r\n  \r\n*2016/5/26*  \r\nAndroid编译环境的搭建。本project在Android Studio中进行开发，现已完成摄像头的调试。  \r\n![](http://i2.buimg.com/6c422cffa02fc44b.png)  ![](http://i2.buimg.com/4583c93b73e2a96b.png)  \r\n````````\r\n//主要代码  \r\n@Override\r\n    public void onClick(View v) {\r\n        int id = v.getId();\r\n        if (id == R.id.open_camera){\r\n            String filePath = fileUtil.getAbsolutePath();\r\n            String file = filePath\r\n                    + System.currentTimeMillis() + \".jpg\";\r\n            startActivityForResult(\r\n                    new Intent(MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE).putExtra(\r\n                            MediaStore.EXTRA_OUTPUT, Uri.fromFile(new File(file))),\r\n                    REQUEST_CAPTURE_IMAGE);\r\n        }\r\n    }  \r\n```````  \r\n接下来的任务是继续阅读文献查找资料，寻找第三方基于Android平台能实现3D Rigid Object Tracking的SDK，目前尚在考虑的第三方SDK是Vuforia。\r\n## Project Video\r\n Please refer to the following videos to better under what is 3D object tracking:  \r\n* [3D Object Tracking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOmsnQy6X8I)  \r\n* [Real-Time Markerless 3D Tracking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Dln257k2Sc)  \r\n* [3D Textureless Object Detection and Tracking: An Edge-based Approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJtpBxdDVDU) \r\n* [Real-time Model-based Object Tracking in 3D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNlcw1U7s) \r\n \r\n## You can refer to but not limited to the following references\r\n* Multiple 3D Object Tracking for Augmented Reality, In ISMAR, 2008.\r\n* [https://www.ssontech.com/tutes/tuteobj.html](https://www.ssontech.com/tutes/tuteobj.html)\r\n* Manipulator and Object Tracking for In-Hand 3D Object Modeling, INIJRR, 2011.\r\n* Robust Statistics for 3D Object Tracking, In ICRA 2006.\r\n* Real-time 3D Object Pose Estimation and Tracking for Natural Landmark Based Visual Servo.
