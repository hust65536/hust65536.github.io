  "body": "# Project5: 3D Rigid Object Tracking\r\nThe objective of 3D rigid object tracking is to associate 3D target objects in consecutive video frames and meanwhile estimate the relative pose (3D translation and 3D rotation) between the 3D target and the camera. Rigid means the relative position among object components do not change. For instance, a cup, a book and a car are rigid object while a human face and a cat are non-rigid object. It has a variety of uses, some of which are: humancomputer interaction, security and surveillance, video communicationand compression, augmented reality, traffic control, medical imaging and video editing. 3D object tracking can be especially difficult when the objects are moving fast relative to the frame rate. Another situation that increases the complexity of the problem is when the tracked object changes orientation over time. For these situations the tracking system usually employs a motion model which describes how the image of the target might change for different possible motions of the object.\r\n\r\n## To  Do List\r\n    1.
